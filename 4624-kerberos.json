It is generated on the computer that was accessed.\r\n\r\nThe subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon.

The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).\r\n\r\nThe New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.\r\n\r\nThe network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.\r\n\r\nThe authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.\r\n\t- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.\r\n\t- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.\r\n\t- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.\r\n\t- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.",
